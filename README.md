# Avoid-Clear-Web-Scams-Fake-Sites
[OFFICIAL] We Are Now TOR-ONLY – Avoid Clear Web Scams (Fake Sites Exposed)


To all our users,

Due to government regulations, we have completely shut down all clear web operations. Unfortunately, scammers are now exploiting our name to steal funds. This is our ONLY official statement—do not trust any other source.

🚨 ACTIVE SCAM SITES (DO NOT USE!)

The following fake domains are NOT affiliated with us and will steal your funds:

❌ unijoin.club (and subpages like /en/order/NDvdakyOAbS28U7.html)

❌ unijoin.me (and all subdomains)

How to Spot the Scam:

🔴 Fixed order IDs (e.g., NDvdakyOAbS28U7). Legitimate services generate unique IDs per transaction.

🔴 Static deposit addresses (e.g., bc1qmeakc2gy4jm8pzhffmg2vrtm6d0928tyx5hhgh). Real services use fresh addresses for each user.

🔴 No Tor/darknet presence. We no longer operate on the clear web—any clearnet site is fake.

WHERE TO FIND US NOW

🔐 Only our official Tor site is operational. Do not trust clearnet links, social media ads, or "mirrors."

🔐 Verify URLs via trusted communities (e.g., DarkNet forums, r/UniJoin).

IF YOU’VE BEEN SCAMMED

1️⃣ Stop sending funds—you will not receive your coins.

2️⃣ Report the scam to: Chainabuse (for BTC addresses)

Hosting providers (if the fake site is still up)

3️⃣ Warn others—comment below if you’ve seen other scam domains.

We will NEVER contact you first for deposits or support via clear web.

Stay safe. Verify twice.
